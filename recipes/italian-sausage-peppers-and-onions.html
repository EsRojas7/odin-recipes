    <h3>Ingredients to Note:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Italian sausage:</strong> Sweet italian sausage is perfect for this dish, but if you like hot try using hot italian sausage.</li>
        <li><strong>Butter:</strong> Two tablespoons of butter is all you need to sauté the veggies. You can also use Olive oil if preferred.</li>
        <li><strong>Onions:</strong> Yellow onion or red onion, if you prefer mild flavor just use half and half. Personal recommendation? Always use red.</li>
        <li><strong>Garlic:</strong> Mince four cloves of fresh garlic to add to the vegetable mix for authentic italian flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Bell Peppers:</strong> Slice one red pepper and one green bell pepper.</li>
        <li><strong>Spices and seasonings:</strong> This sausage and peppers recipe is simply seasoned with dried basil and dried oregano.</li>
        although red crushed peppers could be a great addition if preferred.
        <li><strong>Wine:</strong> Opt for a dry white wine such as pinot grigio or sauvignon blanc. Replace with chicken broth or beer if you don't have wine.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4><em>Sausage with peps and onions variations</em></h4>
    <p>I would usually leave comments here with the variations you can make to this dish.</p>
    <p>However since this is actually a very simple dish theres not much to be said in here about it.</p>
    <p>You can change the italian sausage to any other sausage type and this dish is still going to be bomb!</p>
    <p>You name it, polish, argentinian, texas, all type of sausages go good with this preparation, so enjoy this "lazy" meal.</p>
