    <h4><em>Italian sausage sooup with tortellini variations</em></h4>
    <p>In this recipe there's not much i can recommend to change since the flavor profile would change a lot.</p>
    <p>That's why I would recommend this recipe as is, or just change the sausage to something spicy if you prefer.</p>
    <p>You can also side this soup with some garlic bread to dip in the soup and get that sweet italian flavour.</p>
