    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Carbonara is a Roman dish made with eggs, hard cheese, and cured pork.</p>
    <p>It's signature rich and silky sauce comes from beaten eggs tossed with hot pasta.</p>
    <p>The trick to making carbonara is making sure the pasta is hot enought to cook the eggs,</p>
    <p>but not so hot that they curdle.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients to Note:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Olive Oil:</strong> Use 2 teaspoons Olive oil suitable for heat.</li>
        <li><strong>Guanciale:</strong> Buy 1 pound Guanciale, or unsmoked bacon/pancetta if you can't find Guanciale.</li>
        <li><strong>Spaghetti:</strong> 16oz store bought or homemade. Even better if you find Bucatini.</li>
        <li><strong>Eggs:</strong> 3 large eggs to add richness and flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Cheese:</strong> 10 tablespoons Pecorino romano and grate it yourself. But Parmigiano-Reggiano could also be used.</li>
        <li><strong>Seasoning:</strong> Just salt and freshly ground black pepper.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Process of elaboration</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet on medium heat; add guanciale.</li>
        Cook, turning occasionally, until evenly browned and crispy, for 5 to 10 minutes.
        Once cooked remove from heat and drain on paper towels.

        <!-- Images in the elaboration process should be 600x500 so they can look good, otherwise they'll look weird. -->
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water</li>
        stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 9 minutes. Drain and return to the pot.
